        <h3>Our beautiful Space is getting messy! Just like your room needs cleaning,
            the space around Earth needs our help too. Want to join our team of <strong>Space
            Guardians</strong>? There are thousands of bits and pieces floating around our Planet,
            and we are on a mission to learn about them and help keep Space clean for
            all our future adventures.

        <h2>What Do Space Guardians Do?</h2>
        <p><strong>We are Earth's special team of Space protectors!</strong> Long ago, humans started
            sending Satellites into Space. Satellites help us watch cartoons and talk
            to friends far away. But sometimes, Satellites break or get old, leaving
            pieces floating around Earth like sprinkles on a birthday cake!
        </p>
        <p><strong>Space Guardians</strong> like you learn about messy Space and help tell other friends
            about keeping Space clean. We use Science, our Imagination, and Teamwork to
            understand how we can protect our Planet's Space neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Even the smallest Space Guardian can make the biggest difference!
            Every time you learn something new about space and share it with a friend,
            you're helping our mission!
        </p>
